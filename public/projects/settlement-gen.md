The Time-line procedural settlement generator is a procedural settlement simulation game. The simulation allows users to choose the starting parameters of their settlement, and grows a settlement procedurally over time.

This game/simulation was the basis of my MSc by Research thesis, combining the procedural generation of both rural and urban settlements. If you wish to learn more about how this works, a link to the paper is provided below, along with screenshots and a video.
