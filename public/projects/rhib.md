# About
As part of a research project, I built an immersive VR simulator for training participants in powerboating skills. The project was planned as part of a funding bid from the Royal Navy, whic unfortunately fell through due to a number of reasons. Here are some things I'm particularly proud of about the project:

- Fully procedural Gerstner wave implementation.
- Procedural currents using a 2D vector field.
- Custom implementation of in-simulation buoyancy physics.
- Procedural weather system changeable at the press of a button: rain, lightning, cross-currents, etc.
- Trainer view, showing a top-down aerial perspective of where the participant is and their heading. Implemented via RPCs & server-client architecture.
- CG coded Fresnel shader for rendering water.

## The experience
In the experience, participants are tasked to navigate through an obstacle in varying conditions. We found the tool to be useful in teaching folks how to handle boats in open water conditions. My roles in this project was pretty much everything in terms of development -- the buoyancy and current physics, shader work for the water, boat control, virtual reality, and so forth.
