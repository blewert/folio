The RHIB training simulator game is a virtual reality experience in which players drive a realistic RHIB 
in an open water environment. The simulation involves varying weather conditions, such as rain, lightning and
cross currents which affect the driving of the boat. Players are given a virtual reality headset, with a throttle apparatus, 
and are tasked with navigating an obstacle course.

My roles in this project was pretty much everything -- the buoyancy and current physics, shader work for the water, boat control, virtual reality, and so forth.
