# Introduction
Every year, I end up being wheeled out by the university to talk about quaternions. They know that it's one of those concepts that I could about at length with anyone. I love talking about their uniqueness as a mathematical concept, their history, and of course, their application in representing rotations in 3D space. 

## History
Any article about quaternions worth its salt simply has to mention the interesting story of their discovery. The history of these four component structures (hence *quat*) is fascinating. For years, Sir William Rowan Hamilton struggled with the task of extending complex numbers up to higher spatial dimensions. How to work with complex numbers in $\mathbb{R}^2$ was well understood at the time, though it wasn't clear if they could generalised to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Complex numbers found utility in describing points on the unit circle in 2D space. But what if we wanted to apply the same principle to 3D? 

Hamilton came across this problem as an astronomer, knowing that a generalisable system could provide an accurate method of describing the movements of celestial bodies. Planets, stars and the like are all objects in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and as such, using complex numbers to represent their movements would be incredibly useful. Hamilton found that adding and subtracting complex numbers in 3D was fairly easy, and the generalisation from $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ could be made with little effort. But multiplication was another matter, and it was this problem that Hamilton brooded on for years. In fact, Hamilton was pestered by his son every morning about the topic:

:::blockquote
*Every morning in the early part of October 1843, on my coming down to breakfast, your brother William Edwin [Hamilton's son] and yourself used to ask me: "Well, Papa, can you multiply triples?" Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head, "No, I can only add and subtract them."*
:::
â€” Hamilton, [in a letter](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Letters/BroomeBridge.html) to his son Archibald, *August 5 1865*.

A bolt from the blue struck Hamilton as he was walking the canal with his wife on the morning of October 16, 1843. As he was walking, the idea behind quaternions started to shape in his mind. Suddenly, as if from nowhere, the possibility that quadruples can be multiplied struck him. He quickly realised that three of these numbers could represent 3D coordinates in space whilst also satisfying their multiplicative ability and orthogonality. He couldn't resist carving the basic rules for their multiplication into the side of Broom Bridge:

$$
    \\[1cm]
    \LARGE i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
    \\[1cm]
$$

In the same way that the imaginary axis is orthogonal to the real number line for complex numbers, the same idea here is skilfully communicated for all imaginary axes. In particular, imagine three axes $i$, $j$ and $k$ which are orthogonal to the real number line. The result is a coordinate system in $\mathbb{R}^4$: pretty hard to visualise, and what typically makes quaternions so hard to understand.

From here, Hamilton quickly excused himself at his next meeting and scurried away to examine his newfound concept in further detail. This is described in his original letter to his son, years after the event:

:::blockquote
*But on the 16th day of the same month - which happened to be a Monday, and a Council day of the Royal Irish Academy - I was walking in to attend and preside, and your mother was walking with me, along the Royal Canal, to which she had perhaps driven; and although she talked with me now and then, yet an under-current of thought was going on in my mind, which gave at last a result, whereof it is not too much to say that I felt at once the importance. An electric circuit seemed to close; and a spark flashed forth, the herald (as I foresaw, immediately) of many long years to come of definitely directed thought and work, by myself if spared, and at all events on the part of others, if I should even be allowed to live long enough distinctly to communicate the discovery. Nor could I resist the impulse - unphilosophical as it may have been - to cut with a knife on a stone of Brougham Bridge, as we passed it, the fundamental formula with the symbols, i, j, k; namely,*

$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 $$

*which contains the Solution of the Problem, but of course, as an inscription, has long since mouldered away. A more durable notice remains, however, on the Council Books of the Academy for that day (October 16th, 1843), which records the fact, that I then asked for and obtained leave to read a Paper on Quaternions, at the First General Meeting of the session: which reading took place accordingly, on Monday the 13th of the November following.*
:::
â€” Hamilton, [in a letter](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Letters/BroomeBridge.html) to his son Archibald, *August 5 1865*.

Fun fact: this original letter describing his discovery has four paragraphs, which Hamilton acknowledges as a *quaternion of paragraphs* which I think is adorable.

Since their discovery as a method of representing points and direction in 3D space, quaternions have found many uses over the years. Perhaps their most famous is in representing rotational systems in 3D space and the fact that they are not prone to [gimbal lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock). Quaternions are employed in space travel frequently, though, the Apollo 11 lander was prone to gimbal lock. As such, Michael Collins famously quipped about ["sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas?"](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/30953/did-michael-collins-ask-for-a-fourth-gimbal-for-christmas-is-there-a-recording); referencing quaternions. They are also used a lot in games development, as quaternions provide a lot of useful functions for us. 

I recently visited Dublin with the sole purpose of catching the LUAS up to Broom Bridge and seeing where Hamilton scrawled his famous formula. I was delighted to see that the station has their multiplicative rules etched into the floor not too far from the LUAS stop. The actual inscription itself has long faded away, though a plaque remains on the bridge itself.

More images can be seen in the gallery for this post, at the start of this post -- including a picture of me next to the plaque! ðŸ˜„

## Motivation
This post was largely motivated by my recent trip to Dublin, and the lack of resources on quaternions in the Unity documentation. Quaternions are often framed as an evil, hacky, and complicated number system, but I don't believe that. This post intends to discuss some of the somewhat unknown quaternion functions which aren't well discussed in the Unity API documentation. I will also show you some cool things you can do with quaternions!

# Quaternions and Unity
Quaternions in Unity are represented by the `Quaternion` class and the variety of static methods available to you. They are primarily used for representing the rotation of objects in 3D. Manipulating them in Unity is easy and abstracts away from the raw quaternional math involved, for example, in multiplying one quaternion by another. 

The math used in this section will use the notation of $\mathbf{q} = (x, y, z, w)$, in line with Unity's `xyzw` convention. Quaternions are just a 4-tuple of real values, similar to how a `Vector3` is a 3-tuple of real values $[x, y, z]^T$. When expanded, the quaternion $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{H}$, where $\mathbb{H}$ is the superset of all quaternions, is simply:

$$ 
\Large\begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{q}  &= (x, y, z, w) \\
                &= w + x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} + z \mathbf{k}
\end{aligned} 
$$

Note that $x, y, z$ are coefficients of the imaginary units $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}$ and $\mathbf{k}$ respectively. Like complex numbers, e.g. $a + b \mathbf{i}$ or $2 + 10 \mathbf{i}$, quaternions have both real and imaginary parts. Except quaternions have three imaginary units and one real part. In Unity's `xyzw` notation, $x, y$ and $z$ represent the "imaginary parts" and $w$ represents the "real" part. In Unity you don't really poke around with these components directly. However, we will be discussing them throughout this post, so just keep that in mind.

# Unity's Quaternion operators
You may or may not know that the `Quaternion` class can be operated on. There are two operators that can be used, for a total of three overloads:

- Multiplication (`Quaternion` * `Vector3`)
- Multiplication (`Quaternion` * `Quaternion`)
- Relational equality (`Quaternion` == `Quaternion`)

We will discuss the first two in the following sections. The last relational equality is the subject for another day. ðŸ™‚

## Quaternion * Vector3
If a quaternion $\mathbf{q} = (x, y, z, w)$ is multiplied by a vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ (e.g. $\mathbf{v} = [ \mathbf{v}_0, \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2 ]^T$), it rotates the given point by the quaternion. The [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion-operator_multiply.html) simply describes this as "Rotates the point `point` with `rotation`" which doesn't help much. So what does this actually do?

We can look at the [Unity C# reference repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference/blob/master/Runtime/Export/Math/Quaternion.cs) to get a better idea of what it does:

```cs
 public static Vector3 operator*(Quaternion rotation, Vector3 point)
{
    float x = rotation.x * 2F;
    float y = rotation.y * 2F;
    float z = rotation.z * 2F;
    float xx = rotation.x * x;
    float yy = rotation.y * y;
    float zz = rotation.z * z;
    float xy = rotation.x * y;
    float xz = rotation.x * z;
    float yz = rotation.y * z;
    float wx = rotation.w * x;
    float wy = rotation.w * y;
    float wz = rotation.w * z;

    Vector3 res;
    res.x = (1F - (yy + zz)) * point.x + (xy - wz) * point.y + (xz + wy) * point.z;
    res.y = (xy + wz) * point.x + (1F - (xx + zz)) * point.y + (yz - wx) * point.z;
    res.z = (xz - wy) * point.x + (yz + wx) * point.y + (1F - (xx + yy)) * point.z;
    return res;
}
```

This appears to perform the [standard method](https://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/realNormedAlgebra/quaternions/transforms/index.htm) of multiplying a quaternion $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{H}$ against a vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ as what my professor at-the-time used to call *"a quaternion sandwich"*. I have been teaching it this way ever since. The vector is multiplied by the quaternion $\mathbf{q}$ on the left-hand side, and its conjugate $\mathbf{q}^{-1}$ on the right:

$$ 
    \Large \mathbf{v}' = \mathbf{q} \mathbf{v} \mathbf{q}^{-1}
$$

Unity seems to follow the way that [the .NET library](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/5535e31a712343a63f5d7d796cd874e563e5ac14/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Numerics/Vector3.cs#L519C13-L537C15) and [the XNA](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/28418) framework compute the transformation, to reduce the number of operations performed. Put simply: it applies a rotation to the point that we multiply it by. You don't have to worry too much about the maths. This is useful for transforming points relative an object's rotation without the use of a `Transform` component. Also note that Unity will not allow you to multiply `Vector3 * Quaternion`, only `Quaternion * Vector3`. This is because the multiplication is non-commutative, the `Vector3` *must* be on the right-hand side. Normally, if you wanted to find the local `x` axis of an object, you'd use `transform.right` or the lengthier `transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.right)`. But what if you don't have access to a transform and only a rotation? This is where this operator would be pretty useful.

One example where I have used this recently is when working with Unity's Splines package. The splines package allows you to sample a forward $z$, up $y$ and right $x$ axis using the `spline.Evaluate(...)` family of functions. You can then use these vectors to form a `Quaternion` to represent the orientation at the sampled point on the spline. This can be manipulated to a) rotate objects by the quaternion, so it looks like they are "moving along" the spline and b) offset points locally with this operator. Typically you wouldn't need to use quaternions for offsetting points (as you already have the vectors which form an orthonormal basis), but we'll run with it for illustrative purposes. For example:

```cs
//Sampled position on the spline at t
Vector3 samplePos = spline.Evaluate(...);

//Sampled x, y, and z vectors on the spline at t
Vector3 right = spline.Evaluate(...);
Vector3 up = spline.Evaluate(...);
Vector3 forward = spline.Evaluate(...);

//Build a quaternion which looks along forward, whose up vector is up. This
//omits the forward vector as this can be easily calculated w/ the cross product
Quaternion rotationOnSpline = Quaternion.LookRotation(forward, up);

//Set the rotation!
rollercoasterTrain.rotation = rotationOnSpline;

//Find the left & sides of the track using the rotation
Vector3 leftSideOfTrack = samplePos - (right * rotationOnSpline) * (trackWidth / 2.0f);
Vector3 rightSideOfTrack = samplePos + (right * rotationOnSpline) * (trackWidth / 2.0f);
```

Here is a little example showing the transformation directly:

```cs
//...
[SerializeField] private Transform m_Cube;

private void DrawSolidLine(Vector3 a, Vector3 b, Color col)
{
    Gizmos.color = col;
    Gizmos.DrawLine(a, b);
}

private void DrawDashedLine(Vector3 a, Vector3 b, Color col)
{
    Handles.color = col;
    Handles.DrawDottedLine(a, b, 5.0f);
}

private void OnDrawGizmos()
{
    //Find local left, up and forward vectors of the cube 
    Vector3 leftVec = m_Cube.rotation * Vector3.left;
    Vector3 upVec = m_Cube.rotation * Vector3.up;
    Vector3 fwdVec = m_Cube.rotation * Vector3.forward;

    //Draw the original untransformed axes as dashed lines
    DrawDashedLine(m_Cube.position, m_Cube.position + Vector3.left, Color.yellow);
    DrawDashedLine(m_Cube.position, m_Cube.position + Vector3.up, Color.red);
    DrawDashedLine(m_Cube.position, m_Cube.position + Vector3.forward, Color.blue);

    //Draw the transformed axes as solid lines
    DrawSolidLine(m_Cube.position, m_Cube.position + leftVec, Color.yellow);
    DrawSolidLine(m_Cube.position, m_Cube.position + upVec, Color.red);
    DrawSolidLine(m_Cube.position, m_Cube.position + fwdVec, Color.blue);
}
//...
```

Notices how the local $-x$ (left), $y$ (up) and $z$ (forward) axes are found without using `m_Cube`'s transform at all. Normally you'd expect to see `m_Cube.up` or `m_Cube.TransformDirection(Vector3.up)`. However, this achieves the same result, as can be seen below:

![gif](img/quats/quat-vec3.gif)

Remember, the dashed lines are the original untransformed axes and the solid lines are the transformed ones. As you can see, the transformed vectors align with the local axes of the object. 

This is also useful when you want to apply a rotation locally to a vector, perturbing the vector slightly by some angle. You can imagine this as quite literally taking the vector and rotating it about its origin, along some axis. One example of where this might be useful is representing inaccuracy/recoil of bullets when firing. Normally, a raycast is shot directly from the gun outwards. But sometimes, you want to make the gun a little inaccurate and have a "cone" of bullets. This is normally done by:

- Adding slightly more force upwards/left/right to the bullet upon exit, if physics-based.
- Adding a random global $x$ amount or $y$ amount to the vector.
- Or even more accurate, adding local displacement perturbances with `vec + gun.up * Random.Range(-perturbAmount, perturbAmount)` and similar for `gun.right`.

But what if you specifically wanted to restrict the perturbance based on a cone angle? You'd have to use some trigonometry to figure out how much to perturb on $x$ or $y$ on the local axis of the gun such that an cone angle $\theta$ is satisfied. It's not the hardest thing to do, but it can get ugly quickly. Is there a more elegant solution by using quaternions?

Luckily, this can be done fairly easily with `Quaternion * Vector3`. Here is a little example showing what I mean:

```cs
private void OnDrawGizmos()
{
    //Perturb vector along global y by -angle and +angle
    Quaternion rotLeft  = Quaternion.AngleAxis(-angle, Vector3.up);
    Quaternion rotRight = Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.up);

    //Rotate the vector locally, about the y axis
    Vector3 transformedVecLeft = rotLeft * originalVector;
    Vector3 transformedVecRight = rotRight * originalVector;

    //Show transformed local left & right
    DrawSolidLine(Vector3.zero, transformedVecLeft, Color.yellow);
    DrawSolidLine(Vector3.zero, transformedVecRight, Color.yellow);

    //Show original vector and y axis
    DrawDashedLine(Vector3.zero, originalVector, Color.yellow);
    DrawDashedLine(Vector3.up, -Vector3.up, Color.white);

    //Draw debug text
    Handles.Label(originalVector, $"vector = {originalVector}\nangle = {angle}");
}
```

When `originalVector` is set to `Vector.left`, for example, you can see the result of changing the `angle` value:

![gif](img/quats/rotate-vec.gif)

This works locally for the vector, regardless of where it is in space. Adding some more code to help visualise the transformation:

```cs
//Draw ordinate/abscissa lines to help visualise in 3D
Vector3 projRight = Vector3.ProjectOnPlane(transformedVecRight, Vector3.up);
Vector3 projLeft = Vector3.ProjectOnPlane(transformedVecLeft, Vector3.up);

//Draw them
DrawDashedLine(transformedVecRight, projRight, Color.gray);
DrawDashedLine(transformedVecLeft, projLeft, Color.gray);
DrawDashedLine(Vector3.zero, projRight, Color.gray);
DrawDashedLine(Vector3.zero, projLeft, Color.gray);
DrawDashedLine(projLeft, projRight, Color.gray);
```

We can see that the rotation is applied locally to the vector's orientation, which is pretty neat:

![gif](img/quats/rotate-vec3d.gif)

A more robust example is seen below, implementing the cone of inaccuracy I mentioned earlier.

```cs
private void Update()
{
    //Find random x and y angles to perturb by
    float perturbAmountX = Random.Range(-angle, angle) / 2f;
    float perturbAmountY = Random.Range(-angle, angle) / 2f;

    //Build gun's rotation given the vector
    Quaternion gunRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(originalVector, Vector3.up);

    //Rotate around gun's local y (rot * up) and local x (rot * right) vector, by random angles
    //calculated earlier. These are stored as two separate rotations.
    Quaternion perturbX = Quaternion.AngleAxis(perturbAmountX, gunRotation * Vector3.up);
    Quaternion perturbY = Quaternion.AngleAxis(perturbAmountY, gunRotation * Vector3.right);

    //Combine these two rotations with the * operator (more on this later!)
    Quaternion combinedPerturbance = perturbX * perturbY;

    //Rotate the vector by this perturbance rotation
    Vector3 rotatedVec = combinedPerturbance * originalVector;

    //Draw the original vector and the randomly perturbed one
    Debug.DrawLine(Vector3.zero, originalVector, Color.yellow);
    Debug.DrawLine(Vector3.zero, rotatedVec, Color.gray, 0.1f);

    //Draw axes
    Debug.DrawLine(Vector3.zero, gunRotation * Vector3.up, Color.red);
    Debug.DrawLine(Vector3.zero, gunRotation * Vector3.right, Color.blue);
}
```

There is something to note here, the fact that we combined two rotations into one with the `Quaternion * Quaternion` operator. We haven't yet discussed this, but it will be the next thing to cover. Also note that we build a new quaternions for the perturbance on $x$ and $y$. These are rotated around the local axes of the gun's rotation; note that `gunRotation * Vector3.up` is used. If we used `Vector3.up` instead, this would apply the rotation in global space -- we want the perturbance to be local to the orientation of the gun, hence these lines.

We then combine the two rotations by multiplying them together. These then rotate the vector representing the gun's direction by the perturbance rotation. Then, we draw various lines to visually show what is happening:

![gif](img/quats/firecone.gif)

And now we have a gun with a variable level of inaccuracy, specified by an angular perturbance, all thanks to some obscure `Quaternion` knowledge!



## Quaternion * Quaternion
Multiplying one quaternion by another essentially applies one rotation after another. If you have two quaternions $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{p}$, the multiplication $\mathbf{q}\mathbf{p}$ applies the first rotation $\mathbf{q}$ and *then* the rotation $\mathbf{p}$. This is also true in Unity, the left-hand side is applied first, and then the right.

This has a lot of nice use cases, and we've already seen one in the previous example. In that example, we used the `Quaternion * Quaternion` operator to combine two rotations into a single composite rotation. The first rotation was solely around the gun's up axis ($y$ only, $[0, 1, 0]^T$); we did this with `Quaternion.AngleAxis(...)` which builds a rotation around an axis, given the angle and axis. The second rotation was around the gun's right axis ($x$, $[1, 0, 0]^T$) and was built in a similar fashion. Then, they were combined together into a single quaternion which represented the composite of these two rotations:

```cs
//Build the two rotations
Quaternion perturbX = Quaternion.AngleAxis(...);
Quaternion perturbY = Quaternion.AngleAxis(...);

//Combine them. This applies the rotation perturbX first, and then
//the rotation perturbY. The result is a quaternion which represents
//the composite of the two rotations. You can think of this as "adding"
//the two rotations together.
Quaternion combinedPerturbance = perturbX * perturbY;
```

This operator is also very useful for applying rotations local to a specific orientation. This finds utility in mimicking the parent-child relationship between objects without actually having that hierarchy in place. This works because ultimately, this is how parent-child rotations are calculated anyways. Note that this doesn't take into consideration local translation or scale. But it can be useful in a lot of different scenarios, especially in games. We'll look at a few soon.

If there is a child $C$ whose parent is $B$, and $B$'s parent is $A$, then we can express the relationship as $A \to B \to C$. In this syntax, the relationship $\alpha \to \beta$ defines $\beta$ as a child of $\alpha$. As such, $\beta$'s rotation is dependent on the rotation of $\alpha$. To apply the local rotation $\beta$, we simply apply the rotation of it's parent, $\alpha$ and then $\beta$. 

In a more concrete example, consider the rotation of a tank turret. Here is a tank I modelled in Blender for this example (forgive my modelling skills):

![tank](img/quats/tank.png)


There are three objects at play here, all of which depend on another:

- The tank's body (coloured in *red*), the main body of the tank.
- The turret (coloured in *blue*), which is fixed atop of the main body.
- The barrel (coloured in *yellow*), which is fixed atop of the turret.

Working our way from most-dependent to least-dependent (child to parent), the first object to consider is the barrel's rotation $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{barrel}$. This rotation is local to the turret's rotation $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret}$ such that wherever the turret is rotated, the barrel will follow. Therefore $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{barrel}$. An example showing this can be seen below -- only the turret is rotated here, but note that the barrel rotates *with* the turret.

![tank rotating](img/quats/tank-turret-rot.gif)


The turret's rotation is also dependent on the rotation of the body of the tank, $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{body}$. If the tank is oriented in a certain way, the turret is always situated atop of the body. For example, if the tank body is on an incline, the turret is also inclined upwards. An example can be seen below, where the body of the tank is rotated: notice that the turret and barrel rotate with it:

![tank rotating (body)](img/quats/tank-body-rot.gif)

The turret's orientation is local to the body, therefore $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{body} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret}$. We can also deduce that because $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{body} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret}$ and $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{barrel}$ then the transitive relationship $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{body} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{barrel}$ exists, giving us the final hierarchy of $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{body} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret} \to \mathbf{t}_\textrm{barrel}$.

If we have a local rotation $\mathbf{q}$ which we wish to apply to, lets say, the barrel, then we simply use multiplication to achieve this. For example, suppose that $\mathbf{q}$ is a rotation oriented $20^{\theta}$ around the $x = [1, 0, 0]^T$ axis; e.g. `q = Quaternion.AngleAxis(20, Vector3.right)`. Then we can find the local rotation of the barrel simply with $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret} \mathbf{q}$. This works because we firstly apply the rotation of the turret, giving us the barrel's rotation as a child of the turret. Then, we apply the local rotation atop of this rotation by rotating it by $\mathbf{t}_\textrm{turret}$. Here is a little example of how this would work in Unity:

```cs
//The elevation of the barrel \theta
float barrelElevationInDegrees = 20;

//Build the quaternion which rotates the barrel \theta degrees
//around the x axis
Quaternion localBarrelRot = Quaternion.AngleAxis(barrelElevationInDegrees, Vector3.right);

//Build final rotation: turret * localBarrelRot
Quaternion finalRotation = turret.rotation * localBarrelRot;

//Finally, set rotation
barrel.rotation = finalRotation;
```

This method works well if there is no local translation or scale; after all, there is a reason we rely on the engine to perform parent-child maths for us. However, it can be useful in certain scenarios like these, or if you want to combine two rotations together. You can click [here](files/tank-quat-test.unitypackage) to download the scene, model and script to play around with. ðŸ™‚

## Manual multiplication
Although Unity performs the multiplication for us, we can do it ourselves. There ordinarily would be no reason to (and Unity in fact, advises against playing around with the `xyzw` components themselves), but it can be useful to understand what is happening. Unity quaternions are just a 4-tuple, like any ordinary quaternion. These values represent coefficients on the imaginary axes, and its real value $w$. Therefore, computing the multiplication of two quaternions $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ into a resultant $\mathbf{a}'$ is as straight-forward as following the multiplicative formulas closely.

The expanded multiplication of two quaternions can get ugly quickly, due to the multiplicative laws associated with quaternions and the number of products you have to compute. Unity uses the following formulas for calculating multiplication of two quaternions $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, whose product $\mathbf{a}' = \mathbf{ab}$:

$$
    \mathbf{a}'_x = \mathbf{a}_w \mathbf{b}_x + \mathbf{a}_x  \mathbf{b}_w + \mathbf{a}_y  \mathbf{b}_z - \mathbf{a}_z  \mathbf{b}_y \\
    \mathbf{a}'_y = \mathbf{a}_w \mathbf{b}_y + \mathbf{a}_y  \mathbf{b}_w + \mathbf{a}_z  \mathbf{b}_x - \mathbf{a}_z  \mathbf{b}_z \\
    \mathbf{a}'_z = \mathbf{a}_w \mathbf{b}_z + \mathbf{a}_z  \mathbf{b}_w + \mathbf{a}_x  \mathbf{b}_y - \mathbf{a}_y  \mathbf{b}_x \\
    \mathbf{a}'_w = \mathbf{a}_w \mathbf{b}_w + \mathbf{a}_x  \mathbf{b}_x + \mathbf{a}_y  \mathbf{b}_y - \mathbf{a}_z  \mathbf{b}_z \\
$$

Then, the result $\mathbf{a}' = (\mathbf{a}'_x, \mathbf{a}'_y, \mathbf{a}'_z, \mathbf{a}'_w)$ can be calculated and used as the result. You can see this internally [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference/blob/master/Runtime/Export/Math/Quaternion.cs#L87). 

## Manual functions
Other quaternion functions are quite easy to implement in Unity, though there is not much reason to do so. Sometimes though, you need to implement a custom solution to fit certain spaces which don't align with Unity's rotational coordinate system (looking at you, Shuster!). Or it may be that you want a function to take in radians, rather than degrees.

One example is `Quaternion.AngleAxis(...)`, which seems like it would be hard to implement. It is actually surprisingly easy. If you have the axis $\mathbf{v} = [\mathbf{v}_x, \mathbf{v}_y, \mathbf{v}_z ]^T$ and you want to find the rotation around it by $\theta$ radians, it's quaternion form is simply:

$$
\Large 
\begin{aligned}
    \theta_s &= \sin{\left( \theta / 2 \right)} \\
    \theta_c &= \cos{\left( \theta / 2 \right)} \\
    \mathbf{q} &= (\mathbf{v}_x \theta_s, \mathbf{v}_y \theta_s, \mathbf{v}_z \theta_s, \theta_c) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Put simply, the vector portion of the quaternion ($x, y, z$ coefficients) are set to the respective components in $\mathbf{v}$ scaled by $\theta_s$. Then, the real part $w$ simply becomes $\theta_c$. Expanded into it's classical form it becomes:

$$
\Large
    \mathbf{q} = \theta_c + (\mathbf{v}_x \theta_s)\mathbf{i} + (\mathbf{v}_y \theta_s)\mathbf{j} + (\mathbf{v}_z \theta_s)\mathbf{k}
$$

A solution in code is much easier to understand however. Here's one that you can try out in Unity:

```cs

/// <summary>
/// Builds a rotation around axis by angle given
/// </summary>
/// <param name="radians">The angle</param>
/// <param name="axis">The axis to rotate around</param>
/// <returns>A rotation around the axis</returns>
private Quaternion AngleAxis(float radians, Vector3 axis)
{
    //Theta C and S from formula
    float thetaC = Mathf.Cos(radians / 2);
    float thetaS = Mathf.Sin(radians / 2);

    //Multiply the axis by sin, giving us a result
    Vector3 scaledV = axis * thetaS;

    //Build quaternion of form q = (sv.x, sv.y, sv.z, cos)
    return new Quaternion(scaledV.x, scaledV.y, scaledV.z, thetaC);
}
```

I hope you enjoyed this post, and stay tuned: there are more things to be discussed about the quaternion class which I hope discuss in second post. ðŸ™‚
