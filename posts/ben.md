Heyo! I'm Ben. I'm a developer, designer and academic originally from North Wales, currently living in Stoke-on-Trent. I studied at Bangor University, gaining a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science in 2016. I then went on to study and work at the University of Lincoln, graduating with an MSc by Research focusing on Procedural Content Generation in 2019. At UoL I had the opportunity to work as an academic, software developer, mentor and researcher; having been involved in a variety of projects over the years.

Some of these include:
- Building an AR prototypical interface for teleoperated nuclear disposal robots, using the HoloLens 2, `msgpack`, C++, and ROS.
- Updating and redesigning the full-stack architecture for the University of Lincoln's School of Computer Science digital signage system.
- Designing and developing the architecture of a WebGL-based retro arcade system for the University of Lincoln; and its successor at Staffordshire University which supports any native full-screen app.
- The design and creation of a variety of public-facing recruitment institutional activities, including:
    - VR games
    - An immersive motion-actuated racing simulator, connected up to a receipt printer (for printing lap times) and race leaderboard system
    - A public-facing web-based IDE, similar to code academy, for prospective games development applicants.
- And much more!


I have worked previously for Picselica as a senior developer on a number of private or unreleased VR-based projects. I have also carried out contract work on XR projects, especially those involving Unity. Finally, I have been a full-stack developer for a number of years and contributed to a range of public-facing projects (which are mostly institutional).

I am currently an academic at Staffordshire University, mostly delivering & designing course content for several games programming modules. I also get involved in leading a variety of projects to bolster our recruitment efforts. I have previously been involved in KTPs, SDIPs and supervision of other projects. I also love helping early career research folks towards publishing their first papers. I am also in the final stages of writing up my PhD thesis, which focuses on sensory congruency and correlates in motion simulation, and how it affects participants in VR. We have found some fascinating insights which are largely [disseminated](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9LBoXQAAAAJ&hl=en) in some recently published papers.

## Research
I enjoy researching a variety of domains and have published several papers over the years. I would summarise my research interests as:

- Virtual Reality
- Sensory Congruency & Motion Simulation
- Procedural Content Generation 
- Optimisation of agent-based algorithms
- Computer Graphics


## Outside of work
Outside of my job and programming, I have a number of things I do. I'm probably a bit *too* obsessed with coffee and buy a lot of beans. Shoutout to my favourite roastery, [Bad Coffee](https://www.drinkbadcoffee.com/). I have a million different french presses, two filter machines, an espresso machine, a V60 drip, Aeropress and more. I think I need to cut down a bit. ðŸ˜¬

I enjoy skating, especially on hot days along the North Welsh coast. Had a nasty bail recently. I play a lot of acoustic guitar and sometimes, though very rarely, I play on stage. I love cooking, especially anything Italian. I also love exploring new places and doing my bit to keep the Welsh language alive; big up [cymdeithias](https://cymdeithas.cymru/). I also love modern art, especially anything digital. You may have noticed some of my favourites on the background of my homepage!

I love music and I'm a big fan of surf rock, bedroom pop, country, shoegaze and indie. Check out my [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/31nczj25g7qu4jy4zmdmvszuspvi) if you want to. I love getting involved in reviewing papers for venues I'm fond of, or helping out with organisational efforts. I have a rabbit called Churchill whose favourite food is cabbage. I also love heading out to the US to see my family and consume my own body weight in beef jerky. ðŸ¥“
