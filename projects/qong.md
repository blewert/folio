Qong is a one-player pong clone in which players play pong against themselves, similar to a game of squash. Qong
was made in approximately 4 hours in a game jam, built as a game for the Research Arcade project. Player telemetry
(such as paddle speed, reaction time and total high-score) is recorded and stored in an online database for further analysis.
