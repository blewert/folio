Elemental Assault: The Boulder Wars is a scrapped game developed by Picselica. The game was a virtual reality tower defence game, in which the player must wield a variety of bow-based weaponry to fend off elemental soldiers as they attempt to siege the player's tower. Players can unlock weapons through crate drops, and fight in a procedurally generated, low-poly canyon.

My role in this game's development was programming/developing the large majority of the game, as well as creating the procedural low-poly terrain system. I also created the logo and VR menu interface. Links to videos and screenshots are provided below.
