# Portfolio of Benjamin Williams
This is a public repository for my portfolio, which is hosted at https://benwillia.ms/ or https://blewert.github.io/folio. The site is entirely designed & developed by myself, and is largely built atop of React and Webpack. The repository is based atop of [tanirascia's wonderful webpack template](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate), with some custom modifications.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repo, run `npm i` and `npm run start`. You can also look at `.github/workflows/*` to see how a CI/CD pipeline can be built. But, to get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blewert/folio

cd folio
npm i
npm run start
```
